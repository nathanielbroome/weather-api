I used http://ip-api.com/json/ to get the location of the IP address requesting service. Next, I used that information to feed the coordinates of the lattitude and longitude on the weather.gov API. Based on that information, I was able to build an app that relays the weather info no matter where you are at.
However, render.com only has certain regions available 
Oregon, USA
Ohio, USA
Virginia, USA
Frankfurt, Germany
Singapore

when hosting content (maybe that's because I am using the free account). As you may be able to tell the region I am currently using is Oregon, USA. 
I'm a little disappointed because I am pretty proud of myself and all the work I put in to make this app work, but it is what it is.
